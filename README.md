# Lumos Hackathon


[Fluence](https://fluence.network/) is excited to co-sponsor [Lumos' Buidl For Web3](https://www.hack.lumoslabs.co/) hackathon.

## About Fluence

Fluence provides the protocol, infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Fluence nodes host discoverable services comprised of WebAssembly modules, using Wasm standards to link modules and access external resources. Service discovery is achieved by p2p function addressability rather than REST or JSON-RPC.

The control flow of service execution is abstracted by Aqua, Fluence's purpose-built distributed systems programming language. Aqua simplifies the creation of distributed algorithms, such as replication, consensus, parallel execution, etc., on top of distributed function calls, and also to deploy and orchestrate services on remote nodes. As a result, the Fluence protocol and solution stack allows you to quickly and effectively create and implement Web3 protocols and reliable decentralized applications.
